# Katâlepsāra
Katalepsis and samsara—A platform for cyclical comprehension.

Cicero relates that Zeno would illustrate katalepsis as follows:

> he would display his hand in front of one with the fingers stretched out and say "A visual appearance is like this"; next he closed his fingers a little and said, "An act of assent is like this"; then he pressed his fingers closely together and made a fist, and said that that was comprehension (and from this illustration he gave to that process the actual name of katalepsis, which it had not had before); but then he used to apply his left hand to his right fist and squeeze it tightly and forcibly, and then say that such was knowledge, which was within the power of nobody save the wise man

Samsara is an eastern philosophical term literally meaning "wandering" or "world," with the connottation of cyclic, circuitous change. 

Our current milieu is drowning in information yet starving for knowledge. Remember, knowledge has to be digested. Only then does it become wisdom. Indigestion of information has become a problem. We're gaining weight and not nutrition.

My problem began as an instiable curiosity with an exponential rate of incoming information. Some was signal, but much was noise. My question was: "How can I effectively differentiate signal to noise with respect to my precious time?" More generally, much of what we consume is nonsense—how can we consume more sense?

In an attempt to remedy this issue, I subscribed to RSS feeds to tune into signal and mitigate much of the noise that clutters the surroundings of high signal information. However, the rate of RSS feeds have become too much to manage. In order to process much of this information, I am now beginning to turn to technology as a confidant.

This application aims to leverage AI in summarizing RSS feed content according to user criteria. For instance, an RSS folder of various philosophy blogs can be summarized weekly based on their content. Thus, capturing signals, or at the very least capturing the concepts. If a user is more interested in a particular concept, they can prompt the application to specify the article(s) of origin from that timeframe.

I can also imagine this application expanding in the future to accomodate a more general audience in their consumption of information and tailoring it to be more eclectic in nature. For instance, many people consume information in isolated echo chambers which leads to the illusion of comprehension. They are climbing a ladder, but the ladder is on the wrong wall. Here, I aim for a ladder with which truth is the foundational wall. I want to construct an application that can be a platform that leads people to become independent thinkers on their own accord with the aid of truth. In essence, we've ended up with a bucket of fish and no rod or concept of hpw to fish. This application aims to resolve this issue along with the many other tangential issues facing our milieu.
